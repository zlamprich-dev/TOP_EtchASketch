# "Etch-A-Sketch" Project

## Description

This project creates a grid of squares based on user input. The squares start with a transparent background and will adjust background color to a random RGB value as the user hovers over them. This effect is achieved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **User Input:** Users can specify the number of grid squares.
- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** The grid squares are dynamically created based on user input.
- **Hover Effect:** Hovering over the squares gradually increases their opacity until they become fully opaque.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. Click the "Create Grid" button.
3. Enter the number of grid squares you want in the prompt.
4. Hover over the grid squares to see the progressive opacity effect.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the basic HTML structure and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the grid squares and container.
- `etchaSketch.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for creating the grid and handling the hover effect.

## Example

1. Upon opening the `index.html`, you will see a "Create Grid" button.
2. Click the button and enter a number, for example, `16`.
3. A 16-square grid will appear. Hover over the squares to see them change color.
